# elisp-problem-solving

This hobby project uses Emacs Lisp to solve numeric puzzles as those proposed by Project Euler.

This is a personal, exploratory project with no fixed roadmap. Its aim is essentially to improve my skills. Development happens irregularly as time permits.

Project Euler solved are: [1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1), [4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4), [5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5), [6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6), [9](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9).
